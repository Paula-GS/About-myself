# :woman: About

My name is Paula and I am in my thirties. I love learning, that is why I studied translation, so there is always a chance to learn something new. Working in different positions I realized when I encounter a problem, I find patterns in it and then solve it creatively. Also, I have leadership habilities when a task is assigned. My research capabilities help me to find a solution, or I need to learn a new skill I can find a way to do it. The pandemic made me realize I needed a change of paths, and in late 2021, I applied for a scholarship for a programming Bootcamp, where I have been learning to code and found out I love front-end.
